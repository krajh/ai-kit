# ai-kit (OpenCode Team Kit)

A lightweight, installer-first OpenCode configuration kit for teams.

**Supports WSL, Linux, and macOS** (x86_64/amd64/arm64 architectures).

## Quick Start

### Automatic (curl | bash)

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/krajh/ai-kit/releases/latest/download/install" | bash
```

This installs the kit **into OpenCode’s config directory**:

- `~/.config/opencode/versions/<tag>/` (versioned content)
- `~/.config/opencode/current` → the active version

To keep the config easy to use (and not nested), the installer exposes the kit at the top-level via symlinks:

- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` → `~/.config/opencode/current/opencode.json`
- `~/.config/opencode/agent` → `~/.config/opencode/current/agent`
- (same for `protocols/`, `skills/`, `plugin/`, `AGENTS.md`)

To pin a specific release:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/krajh/ai-kit/releases/latest/download/install" | \
  bash -s -- --version v0.1.7
```

Update an existing install (download + apply immediately):

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/krajh/ai-kit/releases/latest/download/install" | \
  bash -s -- --command update
```

### Manual (download installer)

1. **Pick a release**: https://github.com/krajh/ai-kit/releases
2. **Download the installer** and run it:

```bash
TAG="v0.1.7"

curl -fsSL -o ai-kit-install \
  "https://github.com/krajh/ai-kit/releases/download/${TAG}/ai-kit-install"
chmod +x ai-kit-install
./ai-kit-install install
```

### Installer options

The installer supports the following commands:

| Command    | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `install`  | Fresh installation of OpenCode configuration to `~/.config/opencode`.                                                       |
| `update`   | Update an existing installation. Validates install state, archives the prior config, and applies the latest files in place. |
| `status`   | Check the current installation status and version.                                                                          |
| `rollback` | Restore the previous configuration from backup.                                                                             |
| `dry-run`  | Validates prerequisites, simulates an install, and reports the actions without touching `~/.config/opencode`.               |

After installation, the installer is also available at:

- `~/.config/opencode/current/ai-kit-install`

This kit will:

- Set up OpenCode configuration for corporate use
- Install protocols and agent definitions
- Configure sensible defaults for team collaboration

## Requirements

- **WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux), **Linux**, or **macOS** (x86_64/amd64/arm64 architecture)
- **curl**, **tar**, **mkdir** (standard utilities)
- No special privileges required

## What's Included

### 📋 Protocols

- **Delegation Protocols**: Professional agent coordination and escalation
- **Tool Usage Guide**: Efficient tool selection patterns

### 🤖 Agent Framework

- **Professional Agent Definitions**: Corporate-friendly agent templates (coordinator, architect, implementer, reviewer, research, strategist)
- **Agent Routing**: Clear selection criteria for optimal agent choice

### ⚙️ Configuration

- **opencode.json**: Production-ready configuration with plugin defaults
- **Skills Library**: Playbooks for delegation, testing, and tool authoring
- **Plugin Support**: Memory integration and roadmap management

## Environment Variables

- **AITOOLINGKEY**: API key used by the `aitooling` provider in `opencode.json`.
  - If missing, `ai-kit-install` will prompt (input hidden) during `install` and `update`, then persist it to `~/.config/opencode/.env`.
  - In non-interactive environments (CI), the installer fails with instructions.
  - To disable prompting (fail fast), pass `--no-prompt` to `ai-kit-install`.

```bash
# Prefer setting in your shell env (installer will persist it into ~/.config/opencode/.env)
export AITOOLINGKEY="<your_key>"

# Or run without prompting (CI)
./ai-kit-install install --no-prompt
```

- **BASE_URL**: Optional base URL override for API endpoints.
  - Only needed if you want to override the default base URL from `opencode.json`.
  - If not set, the default from configuration will be used.
  - Useful for custom API gateways or proxy services.

```bash
# Set both variables when using curl | bash
export AITOOLINGKEY="<your_key>"
export BASE_URL="https://api.example.com/v1"

# Then run the installer
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/krajh/ai-kit/releases/latest/download/install" | bash
```

- **SKIP_VERIFY**: Set to `true` to skip cryptographic signature verification of release artifacts. This may be necessary in restricted network environments where cosign cannot connect to the OIDC provider. **Security warning:** Enabling this bypasses authenticity checks and can allow tampered or malicious artifacts to be installed; use only in exceptional cases and in trusted, controlled environments, and never set it as a default.

```bash
# WARNING: Disables signature verification; use only in exceptional, trusted environments
SKIP_VERIFY=true ./ai-kit-install install
```

### How Updates Work

- **Automatic checks**: the `ai-kit-updater` plugin checks GitHub Releases at most once per 24h
- **Staging**: new versions are downloaded and extracted into `~/.config/opencode/staging/<tag>/`
- **Apply on restart**: on the next OpenCode start, the updater moves the staged version into `~/.config/opencode/versions/<tag>/` and flips `~/.config/opencode/current`
- **Preservation**: Your user-owned files are always preserved:
  - `~/.config/opencode/.env` (environment variables)
  - `~/.config/opencode/local/` (custom configurations)
- **Rollback**: previous installs are archived in `~/.config/opencode.backups/` for recovery

## Customization

### Adding Your Own Agents

1. **Create Agent Definition**: Copy an existing agent definition (e.g., `agent/implementer.md`) as a template
2. **Edit Agent Profile**:
   - Focus on technical capabilities and expertise
   - Use professional, neutral language
   - Provide clear escalation paths and decision criteria
3. **Register in Configuration**: Add to `opencode.json` agents list
4. **Update AGENTS.md**: Document your agent in the agent matrix

### Corporate Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on technical capabilities and expertise
- ✅ Use professional, neutral language
- ✅ Provide clear escalation paths and decision criteria
- ✅ Include accountability metrics and quality gates

```

## Usage

### Configuration is active after installation. Select agents by technical need:

```bash
# For system architecture
# Use architect agent for design and planning

# For implementation
# Use implementer agent for coding tasks

# For quality assurance
# Use reviewer agent for code review
```

### Protocol Compliance

All agents follow strict professional protocols:

- Continuous progress reporting
- Immediate escalation of blockers
- Sequential task execution
- Quality gate enforcement

### Coordinator interaction guide

- **Elect a coordinator before you begin.** The `coordinator` persona is intentionally left undefined so your team can pick or build the persona that matches your role model.
- **Do not work in isolation.** All agent work must be routed through the coordinator: plan approvals, architectural decisions, and blocker escalations go through the coordinator, even if it means pausing in place.
- **Keep the coordinator in the loop with short STATUS UPDATEs.** Follow the delegation protocol reporting format (COMPLETED / STARTING / CONTINUING with BLOCKERS) so the coordinator always has visibility.
- **Use the coordinator as the final gate.** Before calling something “done,” share verification loop results and documentation updates with the coordinator for final sign-off.

### Escalation and issue reporting

- **Escalate through the `ESCALATION TO COORDINATOR` format** defined in `protocols/DELEGATION_PROTOCOLS.md`. Capture the blocker, context, attempts, needs, and impact in that same structure.
- **Raise issues** (bugs, missing requirements, infrastructure access) by tagging them as `[!]` in your status updates and logging them in your shared issue tracker.
- **Every agent is responsible** for the escalation cadence: even if the blocker seems minor, use the escalation template so the coordinator can track it formally.
- **Escalations must happen immediately** when uncertainty, blockers, or decisions emerge—the coordinator should never guess or proceed without that signal.
